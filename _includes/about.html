                    <h3 class="section-subheading text-muted">I'm a computer science undergraduate student at UC Berkeley pursuing a career in software engineering. I've been coding since I was in high school and ever since I've been mesmerized by how commands typed onto an IDE have so much impact on our lives. I enjoy making my ideas tangible through diverse personal projects where I can explore CS and pick up new skills. I'm currently seeking technology internships. As hobbies, I also enjoy running in nature reserves and learning new vegetarian recipes. The purpose of this website is to allow me to showcase projects and give more insight on my CS journey. Please feel free to contact me through email.</h3>
